This is because they keep keyword searches in mind. What you want to achieve with a machine learning approach is to cover what is most relevant on Google and retrieve the pages that a simple keyword won’t find.\nWhen you cast adverse media as a search optimised (SOE) ice berg, having a simple but well defined typology becomes really valuable.\nThe typology allows us to demonstrate the relevancy of our sources. It helps us show clients that we cover the tip of the ice berg by which I mean the domains that rank high on Google. We can then point to the sources below the tip, those sources that we curate and which an AML officer would likely miss with a simple keyword search.","best-practices#Best Practices":"Adverse Media, also known as negative news screening, requires that companies identify risks associated with a company or individual in media. Traditionally, compliance officers use Google and keyword searches to find articles, but this process has largely been automated by machine learning models that can identify risks in thousands of articles online.\nThe explosion in the number of articles that companies process has led to confusion in the compliance industry as to what we mean by “good coverage” when we talk about adverse media. People fall back on quantity as a measure of good coverage when they shouldn’t since adverse media is associated with high levels of noise.\nMany sources are simply not relevant and one provider that I reviewed braged about scraping 200,000 domains. Among these domains were recipe blogs. Part of the reason why we don’t have a definition of “good” in adverse media is because there is no standard way of describing sources.\nIn this article I’ll share with you how I designed an adverse media typology and why you should focus on the relevance of your adverse media sources rather than their percieved reliability.\nTypology of sources in adverse media My task as a researcher on Comply Advatange’s adverse media team was to build a typology that would help us communicate the sources we cover to clients. Our adverse media typology had to explain why we selected those specific sources and not “everything”.\nThe table below is the result of iterations with clients and regulatory affairs and it serves as an example of how we can define sources in the world of adverse media.\nTypology Description International newspaper News websites, news aggregators, online websites, international newspapers published in more than one language and distributed in more than one country. National newspaper A newspaper distributed in one country. Regional \u0026 local newspaper A newspaper distributed in a city or region Judicial authority Any soure extracted from a court or judicial ministry website. Police authoriy A source extracted from police department or ministry. For example, police blotters or watch press release. Public authority A source extracted from a public authority or international organisation Industry or professional blogs A blog or company website published by a professional or company The legal research behind the typology The taxonomy is based on best practices rather than regulatory requirements. What I found from legal research and from working with our regulatory affairs team is that adverse media regulatory requirements are broad and pretty similar regardless of country.\nRegulatory requirements do not provide by design a clear definition of what sources an AML officer should cover and I noticed this in client calls since clients themselves rarely could tell “what sources” they really want. The benefit of working in a regulatory landscape with broad definitions is that it gives you freedom to shape and optimise your typology.\nIn the absence of strict regulatory requirements, I turned to industry recommendations of best practices to determine what “good” is in adverse media. One organisation that publishes best practices is the Wolfsberg Group.\nBest Practices In their recommendations, the Wolfsberg Group outline a clear preference for international, national, and regional newspapers in order of prefence.\nThey mention in their report that compliance officers should rely on news agencies and national newspapers since they provide higher quality reporting and editorial oversight. These sources provide content that is corroborated and edited by network participants. The Wolfsberg Group lists regional and local newspapres as useful since they report on events which are not covered by large scale outlets but note that these sources can often be less reliable.","recap#Recap":"Adverse Media is full of noise and because the industry has yet to come to terms with what we mean by “good media coverage”, the focus remains on quantity rather than cutting through the noise. With the help of a typology of sources in Adverse Media, we can pivot the conversation and discuss “relevancy”. This way, the industry can ask whether an AML provider curates relevant sources in addition to what ranks highest on Google.","the-legal-research-behind-the-typology#The legal research behind the typology":"","typology-of-sources-in-adverse-media#Typology of sources in adverse media":"","why-the-typology-is-not-a-ranking-sources#Why the typology is not a ranking sources":"My initial reaction to the Wolfsberg Group was to build a typology surrounding the concept of reliability, placing public, judicial, and government sources as the most reliable sources followed by newspapers and blogs. However, while meeting with clients I learnt that prioritising certain sources opens up the trap door to quanity over quality.\nThe question that clients would have after discussing our coverage would almost without exception be something along the lines of: “so why can’t we have more judicial sources?” The answer is usually that there are only so many courts in a country. Instead of ranking sources, I thought of building the taxonomy around the concept of relevance."},"title":"Redefining Good Coverage in Adverse Media with a Source Typology"},"/posts/groupint/":{"data":{"":" Graph of networks on Telegram In recent years, Telegram has become popular for threat actors to engage in illicit activity.

Who’s who in the sanctions space has, as a result, become elusive when there are characteristics, data sets, and methods of revealing sanctioned entities and their networks.\nLets explore three common steps in the research process behind investigations in the space of anti-money laundering solutions, from the the design of research methods to the collection and analysis of information.\nResearch Design Ontology The firt step in researching who’s who in the sanctioned space is knowing how to describe entities and relations beetween them. In industry, we describe our domain and its objects in an ontology.\nAn ontology is a formal naming and definition of categories, properties, and relations betweeen concepts, data, or entities.\nI recommend using the Follow the Money’s ontology.\nFollow the Money\nFollow the Money is an ontology that is commonly used in anti-corruption investigations.\nTheir ontology defines entities revelant in such investigations, like people or companies, and helps investigators create a graph of relationships.\nOne of the most common tasks for an investigative reporter is to work out if one thing is the same as another. Is the person who owns a sanctioned company the same guy who is a mayor in my city?\nMany facts might provide hints that allow us to establish if he is “our guy”. Do the individuals have the same name, date of birth, nationality, passport number? Do we know about links to other individuals or companies in both data sets?\nWhen you have a clearly defined ontology, you can turn representations of objects and events into complex data and compile and cross-reference these hints.\nThe Follow the Money ontology consists of schemata ie object types that exist as an inheritance hieracy, rooted in things and events.\nThings describe real-world objects like people, Companies, Assets, Court Cases. You can think of things as entities.\nIntervals are business interests, court cases, sanctions, and transactions and are useful for linking entities together, possibly over time.\nBelow is an interactive graph view of FMT ontology.\nOnce you have an ontology that structures your domain and its objects and relations, you can build a taxonomy to describe and group your information.\nBuild a taxonomy While an ontology is a formal representation of knoweldge that defines concepts and relationships within a domain in a structured way, a taxonomy concerns the classification of entities based on their characteristics.\nTaxonomies are used to group types of entities into categories.\nFor example, when we talk about associations and relationships in the sanctions space, we need ways of describing the type of entity or relationship.\nAn associated entity could be an entity type: person, organisation, or vessel. If we know that our entity is a person, we can class his or her relationship to the sanctioned entity.\nTaxonomy of relationships\nRelationship Definition Example Employee The associated person is employed by the sanctioned individual A nuclear engineer working for sanctioned company Owned or controlled by The associated organisation is owned or controlled by the entity it is connects with OO NOVATEK-PERM is a subsidiary that is owned by sanctioned OAO NOVATEK Family member An associate is a spouse, uncle, aunt, child, parent of sanctioned person Asma al-Assad is the spoise od Bashar al-Assad Having a taxonomy is crucial to investigations. A good taxonomy lets investigators describe and filter the information they’re collecting.\nCollect data Global sanctions regimes vary as some countries implement and enforce the sanctions of international organisations such as the EU and the UN while others develop their own sanctions programs with their own sanctions lists.\nThe first step in researching sanctioned entities is knowing which ones appear on an official sanctions list.\nKey sanctions lists Government and finanical authorities maintain targeted sanctions lists. These lists are often available online and the lists evolve quickly.\nUN sanctions list is also known as the UNSC Consolidated List. It consists of one list of individual targets and one list of entities and group targets. UN sanctions are imposed by UN security council resolutions when the council determines a country is in breach of international law. US sanctions are the most influential global sanctions regime and consists of multiple sanctions lists. The Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, maintains its primary sanctions lists. The Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list sanctions individuals and companies. The Consolidated Sanctions List contains sanctions information not included in the SDN list. UK sanctions are enforced by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementations (OFSI) and Her Majesty’s Treasury (HTM). Accordingly, UK firms must screen against UK Sanctions List. Australia sanctions are implemented by the Australian Sanctions Office (ASO) and the Department of Foriegn Affairs and Trade (DFAT). These two deparments implement Australia’s sanctions regime and firms must screen against Consolidated List of sanctions. Canada sanctions are implemented under the Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA) and the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (JVCFO). Canadian sanctions are on the [Consolidated Canadian Autonomous Sanctions List]. Japan sanctions are issued under the authority of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (FEFTA) and implemented by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry and the Ministry of Finance. Japan works with the UN, the US, and the EU in compiling its sanctions. China sanctions are issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, since 2020, China’s Ministry of Commerce has developed new sanctions regulations designed as a response to Western sanctions. In China, there is the Unreliable Entity List (UEL) and rules the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law and the Blocking Rules. Data in key sanctions lists Sanctions lists are useful primary sources. They help investigators identify who’s who in the sanctions space and serve as an excellent stepping stone to identifying associates and enablers of sanctioned entities.\nCommon information about sanctioned entities include:\nname alias nationality passport number country of birth reason for being sanctioned Sanctions lists are usually strucuted xml, csv or html format, but can come as unstructured pdfs that require manual extraction. Below is an extract from the UNSC Consolidated List.\niTAi.007 Name: 1: ABDUL LATIF 2: MANSUR 3: na 4: na Name (original script): عبد اللطيف منصور Title: Maulavi Designation: Minister of Agriculture under the Taliban regime DOB: Approximately 1968 POB: Zurmat District, Paktia Province, Afghanistan Good quality a.k.a.: a) Abdul Latif Mansoor b) Wali Mohammad Low quality a.k.a.: na Nationality: Afghanistan Passport no: na National identification no: na Address: na Listed on: 31 Jan. 2001 ( amended on 3 Sep. 2003, 18 Jul. 2007, 21 Sep. 2007, 13 Feb. 2012, 18 May 2012, 22 Apr. 2013 ) Other information: Taliban Shadow Governor for Logar Province as of late 2012.

Investigators can use data points like alias and age or passport number to confirm if the person on the sanctions list is the same as the person in a company register.\nLimit of primary sources Investigating if an individual, vessel, or organisation is subject to financial sanctions is relatively straightforward. You usually return a match after a quick search on one of the sanctions lists.\nThe job of investigating is harder when we want to identify associates or entities enabling the sanctioned person or organisation.\nFor example, identifying if an entity is sanctioned becomes harder when shell companies are involved.\nA company may not show up as sanctioned on sanctions lists, but if a sanctioned entity owns 51% of the company then both the company and the sanctioned entity are sanctioned. This is the OFAC50 rule.\nSanctions lists are excellent primary sources but investigations require a holistic approach. For this, we turn to other sources.\nData Enrichment We use othersources as part of investigations to enrich the data we collect from sanctions lists.\nSources commonly used in investigations range from ownership and land registries to leaked documents, mentions in media, and aggreggated data in databases.\nAn excellent example of how investigators draw on open sources is the investigation into Roman Abramovich and his financial dealings with the Dutch football club, Vitesse.\nRoman Abramovich was subjected to UK and EU sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nBy using the Oligarch Files, a cache of leaked data originating from MeritServus, an offshore service provider based in Cyprus, investigators at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and the Guardian were able to reveal that Roman Abramovich, who then owned Chelsea football club, was the source of all money used to fund the Dutch football club, Vitesse.\nThe Guardian found that Abramovich had covertly funded the 2010 acquisition of Vitesse Arnhem via a network of offshore entities before channelling at least 117 million euros to the club.\nIn this case, their analysis of the Oligarch Files helped investigators enrich the data they already had on Abramovich, leading them to identify 6 companies associated with Abramovich and Vitesse.\nEntity Resolution In AML and illicit finance, we are always striving toward a source of truth. We enrich our data in the hopes of getting to that truth.\nEnriching data requires that investigators perform entity resolution to ensure that they are correctly linking records together.\nEnity resolution is broadly speaking the process of identifying data records in a source across multiple sources that refer to the same entity.\nYou can resolve entities manually, usually by looking at the similarity of their names, age, height, and other data points. As you read these records, you understand if the sources describe the same two peope.\nIf you’re certain the records match, you can merge the records and enrich your entity.\nManually resolving entities is a time-consuming task, so investigators naturally rely on data science to combine records.\nIn the world of data, entity resolution or record matching also goes by the name of some of its techniques, like fuzzy matching, merge purge, data matching or idenity resolution.\nThrough entity resolution, we can identify if two records refer to the same entity and enrich our understanding of that data. Once we have a source of truth, the next step is understanding how to use it.\nNetwork Analysis Data dumps are rarely useful on thier own and the process of collecting, enriching and resolving data should yield a big set of data.\nNetwork analysis is one of the techniques that investigators can use to extract useful information from big data.\nThis useful information teaches us about network risks and broader trends in how illict finance is organised.\nIn the investigation into Roman Abramovich, investigators identfied 6 companies associated with him and the football club Vitesse.\nBy drawing the connections between these entities, we learn who’s connection to whom and how sanctioned individuals like Roman Abramovich use offshore networks to circumvent sanctions.","recap#Recap":"Every investigation requires four simple steps to be successful. Before you start, you should decide on a way of first describing objects and relations and then set up a system of classifying these objects. Once ready, start by identifying and collecting information from reliable sources, then, branch out by collecting data from as many relevant sources as possible. Use entity resolution to match records and find useful insights in your data with network analysis."},"title":"Three steps in sanctions research"},"/posts/ubo/":{"data":{"":"While in New York, I asked a friend about his business in Florida and he explained to me that he is the owner through his Scandinavian business. Tracing his ownership structure would be time consuming and the task is made harder by the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to annul public access to ownership registries.\nThe CJEU ruled that public access contravenes the right to privacy in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Implicit is the claim that evidence is weak to show that public ownership registries prevents crime. Or as my friend put it, the argument for public ownership data is a rehash of: if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear\".\nWhat the court considers “strong” evidence is unclear, so let’s start with the strongest case for public access to ownership registries, namely the practice of fighting illicit finance.","global-witness#Global Witness":"In addition to identifying crime, actors are able to improve ownership data when that data is publically available. Global Witness, working with a group of volunteer data scientists at DataKind UK, analysed the UK’s beneficial ownership registries and successfully identified loopholes, information gaps and suspicous activity.\nThey found that most companies registering their benenficial owners at the Persons of Significant Control registry in the UK, is straightforward, with an average of 1.13 beneficial owners for each UK company.\nHundreds of thousands of these companies file highly suspicious entries that would never have been found were it not for the open data nature of the register.\nGlobal Watch found common methods for avoiding disclosure of a company’s real owners such as disclosing an ineligible foreign company as the beneficial owner, filing a statement that the company has no beneficial owners, or creating circular ownership structures where a company control themselves.\nOf the companies with a foreign owner, 10,000 declare a foreign company as their beneficial owner and of these 72% are in a secrecy jurisdiction.\nTheir analysis resulted in a red flagging system to uncover high risk entries and recommendations to the UK government demonstrating the benefit of open ownership registries.\nPublic ownership data helps civl society, investigative journalists and law enforcement scrutinise data and combine it with other datasets, increasing the likelihood of spotting criminal activity.","is-privacy-an-absolute-right#Is privacy an absolute right?":"Having established that open ownership data, in practice, helps us prevent crime, let’s scrutinise the right to privacy.\nAnxiety about data protection is understandable, especially in consideration of companies like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica known for their exploitation of personal data.\nI understand why my friend sides with the CEUJ and I think he made a good point when he said that open ownership data sounds like “if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.'\nThe right to privacy is essential to our autonomy and it is important to respect privacy.\nHowever, publishing information about who owns companies is different in one important respect, namely that as a business owner you are in the public sphere. As OpenOwnership’s Head of Policy, Zosia Sztykowski explains:\n“Publishing information about who owns companies is fundamentally different. This is about chaning the role that companies play in society. We often forget that the legal form that we call a company can’t exist without the state, and agreements between states. Therefore, they have the right, and even the responsibibility to ensure that they serve a social good. Open ownership data can do just that. All while also providing desirable incentives for legitimate businesses, including reducing the risk of being exposed to bad actors and supporting the stability of economies globally.”\nPrivacy is a critical right, but it isn’t absolute.\nHaving a substantial ownership stake in a company gives that individual access to a range of benefits, including protection from personal liability.\nIn exchange, is it not fair to expect business owners to help society ensure that companies are used for thier intended purposes?\nOpening a company is easy and benefits society as a whole and one unintened consequence of this is that corporations have become easy tools for criminals.\nAs Zosia Stykowski explains, ’there is a balance here to be struck between personal freedoms and the responsibility to create a fairer society.'\nThere is also another important question when we invoke privacy and that is, who exactly are we trying to protect? Closing registries might protect more people with illegitimate intentions than those with legitimate intentions.\nIf the practice of investigating illicit finance teach us anything, it is that criminals thrive in secrecy. The decision to close access to ownership registries has impacted already scarce ownership data, forcing investigators to rely on leaked data.\nThe case for “protecting privacy” tries to safeguard against protecting the wrong people by assuming that those with “legitimate interest” have the right to access ownership registries. While well intended, this presumption has had negative consequences due to the lack of an EU-wide definition of “legitimate” intentions or circumstances”.","legitimate-interest#Legitimate Interest":"The CJEU ruling presumes that journalists and civil society organisations engaged in the prevention of money laundering have a legitimate interest and should be granted access to beneficial ownership information.\nThe absence of an EU-wide definition of “legitimate interest” has has effectively squashed the right of individuals and organisations with a legitimate interest to use the registers.\nJournalists and civil society are unable to access 13 of 27 beneficial ownership registers in the EU, and after the court ruling, eight countries suspended public access to their registers.\nTransparency International’s map is a useful resource to trace the impact of the ruling:","the-open-lux-investigation#The Open Lux Investigation":"Transparency International has documented several cases where public access to beneficial ownership registries enabled journalists and activists to uncover corruption and money laundering. One of these cases is the OCCRP’s Open Lux Investigation.\nIn the Open Lux investigation, journalists analysed beneficial owners registered in Luxembourg and found dozens of foreign citizens linked to corruption, embezzlement, and organised crime and, as Transparency International points out:\n‘What sets the Open Lux Investigation apart from the Panama Papers is that, for the first time, journalists did not have to rely on leaks and, instead, relied on publically available data to uncover hidden owners using Luxembourg companies to own assets and open bank accounts.’\nThe case of the Open Lux Investigation is a clear example of how actors other than law enforcement agencies are crucial to combating corruption and it is a role that the Court of Justice of the European Union recognise in their ruling against public access to ownership registries.","the-panama-papers#The Panama Papers":"The Panama Papers is the most public exposure of the world’s most powerful people and their financial secrets and the impact that those leaks have had serves as an excellent example of the positive impact that public ownership data has.\nMore than 11.5 million records exposed how politicians and criminals use the rogue offshore finance industry to launder money and avoid taxes.\nThe leaks implicated 150 politicians from 50 countries and had serious political fallout as Iceland’s Prime Minister, Sigmundur Davio Gunnlaugsson, was forced to resign from his office amid outrage that his family had sheltered money offshore.\nIn the wake of the revelations that caused snap elections in Iceland, the Guardian used the offshore leaks to shed light on the trail between Vladimir Putin and an offshore network of assets worth $2bn.\nInvestigative journalists and their hard work not only helped close Mossack Fonseca, the infamous Panamanian law firm and target of the leak, but has also led to the prosecution of the firm’s owners, Lauria Paz and Ramon Fonseca who are defendants in a case in Panama where they are being tried for “crimes against public economic order”.\nHow Lauria Pax and Ramon Fronseca operated Mossack Fronseca and how their crimes impacted ordinary people inspired “The Laundromat”, a film starring Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman.\nThe Panama Papers show that transparent ownership is vital to fighting corruption and that when ownership structures are made public, those implicit in illicit finance face legal consequences.\nHold on - is the Panama Papers really a strong case for opening ownership registries? After all, the trenche of 11 million documents are a leak of sensitive information from a shadowy organisation and not a register where ordinary people set up their business.\nThe whistleblower nature of the Panama Papers is a perfectly valid objection, so let’s look at two investigations that used real ownership registries.","what-the-evidence-tells-us-to-do#What the evidence tells us to do":"Evidence from practice shows that open access is crucial to improving the quality of data in beneficial ownership registries and that public access prevents crime itself.\nIt is also clear that some members states will interpret the CJEU’s ruling conservatively and contravene the spirit of the CJEU ruling, namely to protect both privacy and civil society’s legitimate interest.\nWhat is required are EU rules that leave no space for discrimination against civil society and public watchdogs. Those rules should, instead, enable those who work with the combating of illicit finance to access crucial ownership data."},"title":"What is the evidence for public ownership registries?"},"/posts/what_is_meaning_illicit_money/":{"data":{"":"Despite substantial work from the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF, OECD, and civil society, countries have been unable to reach a political consensus on the term “illicit” in illicit financial flows (IFFs).\nIt is customary in policy debates to distinguish between a narrow and a broad definition of IFFs. The former requires activities that are in breach of the law whereas the latter encompasses unethical acts that are deemed lawful, if unregulated.\nThe distinction between the two policy camps leads to very different policy outcomes. Proponents of the narrow definition argue that transfers associated with tax evasion (illegal) qualify as IFFs while tax avoidance schemes (which comply with the law) do not even though they are unethical. In contrast, advocates of the broad definition argue that avoidance practices should still fall under the definition of illicit finance.\nTax evasion perfectly illustrates the difference between a broad and a narrow definition. This policy area is also a great example of how the narrow/broad definition is conceptually misleading. In reality, drawing the line between “illegal” and “illicit” is hard since illicit activities often involve illegal elements and require circumstantial interpretation.","a-mixed-approach#A mixed approach":"A broad IFF agenda could be a powerful engine for systemic change. It would likely foster regulatory coordination and counter the tendency towards legal fragmentation. However, it is important that the broad definition focuses on law rather than ethics so as to avoid “subjective” interpretations of “illicit”.\nOne definition that lends itself to this ojbective is “unlawful” since this encompasses legal standards that go beyond fixed rules while still allowing for circumstantial legal assessment. Taking a broad approach would help conceptualise IFFs, though, for the purpose of measuring IFFs, more narrow legal definitions that define actors, transfer mechanisms, or origin are required.\nWhat is required, then, is a pragmatic approach that dissolves the IFF agenda into workable modules and indicators. A starting point is thematic areas set by existing IFF-related international initiatives followed by strategic alignment and collaboration between agencies.","activities-associated-with-illicit-finance#Activities associated with illicit finance":"Below are the most frequently cited activities associated with illicit finance:\nTax evasion Money laundering Terrorist financing Fraud Conflict financing Counter-terrorist financing Smuggling Trafficking drugs People or wildlife smuggling Financing of organised crime Counterfeitings Tax avoidance ","illicit-finance-through-the-lense-of-tax-evasion-and-tax-avoidance#Illicit finance through the lense of tax evasion and tax avoidance":"Tax evasion occurs when people or businesses deliberately do not pay tax that they legally owe by underreporting income, over-reporting expenses, or simply not paying taxes. In short, tax evasion encompasses the “hidden economy” in which people “conceal their presence or taxable income” (HM Treasury 2015).\nTax avoidance involves “bending the rules of the tax system to gain a tax advantage that Parliament never intended”. The Result is compliance with the letter but not the spirit of the law. Those who engage in tax avoidance usually take advantage of technicalities for the purpose of reducing tax liability. This typically involves contrived agreements with the purpose of reducing tax.\nIn day-to-day reality, the distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion is blurred as practices fall on a spectrum between tax avoidance and tax evasion. A case depend on its circumstances and legal assessment is seldom simple or obvious, which is whyit is hard to define tax avoidance as strictly illegal or illicit.\nWhat the narrow/broad definition debate unveils is not the illegal versus illicit dilemma, but uncertainty over the legal characterisation of tax arrangements as tax law has transitioned from detailed legal drafting to broad directives such as anti-abuse rules. In addition, the debate conceals the anxiety of policy-makers about the capacity of jurisdictions to enforce tax administration and prosecution if illicit finance is narrowly defined as “illegal activities”.","international-initiatives#International initiatives":"There is already a rich repository of IFF-related international initiatives and strategic alignments that establish legal obligations to prevent illicit financial flows.\nUnited Nations Conventions against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1988 (Vienna Convention).
